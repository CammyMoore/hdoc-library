## Filter
The filters work off of the translation key and the default translation. By typing in the the name of the key or the default translation, the list of translation strings will be narrowed down to the matching text.

## Translating
Under the Translated column you can see the translations which relate to the selected language in the tool bar. If a translation has not been provided it will show the default language of English (British). Clicking on any translation string in this column will open a translation box where you can do one of the following:

* Type your own translation in the text box and save
* Click on `Suggest` to do an automatic translation and save

:::tip
The `Suggest` option will only show if the selected language is different from the language set in your user profile.
