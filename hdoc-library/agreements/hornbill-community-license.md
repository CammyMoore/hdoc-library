## Using the License

The HCL is used where we wish to publish our source code as an open-source project. The license gives us specific protections which are important to us as a business so please ensure you use this as intended.

Please use the following guidelines which sets out how to use the license: -

* Hornbill should only publish source code that has been sanctioned for publication as Open Source, if you are not sure, ask first.
* Do not modify the above license in any way, use as-is
* Every source file should include the above license
* If we make an executable program available that should be packaged as a ZIP file and should include a file called LICENSE, LICENSE.md or LICENSE.TXT that contains the above license
* If we make a project that imports other libraries we should import those dependencies into our own GitHub repository.
* We should give attribution to other open source projects we may import or use parts thereof.
* Special attention needs to be paid when using GPL or LGPL software, these are largely incompatible with the MIT license which is what the HCL (this license) is * derived from. If you are unsure, ask!
